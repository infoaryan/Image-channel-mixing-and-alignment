# Image channel mixing and alignment
<h3>Project description</h3>
In this project we will get our hands on with the channels of the image and also their mixing. We will come to know about
canny edge detection and the physical implementation of it from the scratch.Basically thisproject comes in the domain of the 
computer vision which gives a clear idea of working with the images and the colourful aspects of them.</BR>
